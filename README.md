# finger-extender
Play an unmodified pinball machine with one hand.  Index finger pressed flipper button as usual, middle (or ring) finger presses a switch that fires a current-controlled solenoid that presses the flipper button on the opposite side.

Will eventually put build instructions, stls, schematics, PCBs, etc. in this repository...
